# flixsterJS

Hello! This is a recreation of a project I did during CodePath's Android Development Course. I decided to make the Flixster application with pure JS, HTML, and CSS. This was the first time I did any 'backend' with JS and it turned out pretty good. This project is still ongoing but so far I have been having fun!

Today I completed getting the title and poster from the API Request and displaying them on the website. I made the formatting appealing to the eye and I am now looking to have the option of clicking on the title or image to get specific information on the movie such as the overview and rating.

I have completed the functionality of displaying a specific overview for each movie as a modal. This was a challenging and rewarding accomplishment. With the help and advice of some mentors and friends I have got the job done. See it here:
